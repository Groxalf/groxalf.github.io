I'm Miguel Viera. I work as a developer, consultant and coach at Codesai. I help teams to elevate their taste for quality software.

Welcome to my personal blog, this is going to be an experiment, I have not set up a goal or purpose with it, just a leissure in the mean time. I hope whatever I write here is useful for you, but I can't promise it! :P

Any feedback is welcome and I hope to hear from you. Thank you for passing by!
